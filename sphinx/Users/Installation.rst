Installation
======================

.. important::

    PyRID is still in early development!


1. Install Anaconda python distribution (recommended):

   `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution>`_


2. Download PyRID from the GitHub repository and extract it:

   `PyRID on GitHub <https://github.com/MoritzB90/PyRID>`_

3. Open Anaconda Prompt on your computer.

4. Go to the directory to which you downloaded PyRID:

   >>> $ cd <your directory>

5. Pip install PyRID:

   >>> $ pip install pyrid

To edit your python scripts and run pyrid we recommend to use Spyder or Jupyter Lab, which both come with the Anaconda distribution.
